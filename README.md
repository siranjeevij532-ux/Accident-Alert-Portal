## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This AI-powered accident detection system uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models** to identify **vehicle collisions in real-time** from video footage. The system then:  
✅ Calculates the **severity** of the accident using speed, IoU, and collision impact.  
✅ Retrieves **real-time weather conditions** to assess accident risks.  
✅ Identifies the **nearest police station & hospital** for emergency response.  
✅ Sends **emergency alerts** via **email & SMS** with an attached accident report, images, and video clips.  
✅ Extracts **vehicle number plate using OCR** for insurance and medical processing.  
✅ Automates **insurance claim submission** based on accident damage assessment.  
✅ Notifies **insurance policyholder & nominees** about the accident for immediate action.  
✅ Sends **organ donation alerts** to family members in case of brain death.  
✅ Sends **blood donation requests** to nominees in case of severe blood loss to save time.  
✅ Uses **AI-powered damage estimation** to assist in automatic claim processing.  

> 🔥 **Goal:** To improve emergency response time and reduce accident-related fatalities.

## 🖥 Accident Alert Portal (web frontend)
```bash
pip install -r Requirements.txt
python check_setup.py      # optional: tests PyTorch, model download and camera step by step
# email / weather key / webhook: set them on the Settings page (saved to .env)
python server.py           # open http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/` Live monitor | Start the camera (`0` = webcam, or an `rtsp://` / `http://` URL), watch the annotated feed and live stats |
| `/reports` | Every accident detected, filter by severity |
| `/settings` | Paste your Gmail app password, OpenWeather key and webhook; test email, weather and the hospital/police lookup |
| `/report/<id>` | Full details of one accident: alert message, severity and why, vehicles involved, timeline, weather, nearest hospital/police, evidence frames, clip, printable report |

**Alert system:** when an accident is confirmed, every portal page shows a red banner (with a link to the details page), a toast, a beep and a desktop notification; an email is sent if configured, and `ALERT_WEBHOOK` receives a JSON POST.

**Detection:** only cars, bikes (motorcycles), buses and trucks. Each vehicle is tracked, so speed is per vehicle.
An accident = vehicles overlapping (IoU > 0.2) for a prolonged time; severity is a points score shown with its reasons
(tune the thresholds in `pipeline.assess_severity` on your own footage).

Files: `server.py` (Flask), `live.py` (camera monitor + alerts), `pipeline.py` (detection helpers), `frontend/` (pages).
Troubleshooting: the first start imports PyTorch and downloads the YOLO model (1-2 minutes). Set `YOLO_MODEL=yolo11n.pt` for a faster start on CPU,
or put weights in a `models/` folder to work offline.


## Deploy on Render (PostgreSQL)

1. Push this folder to GitHub (large `.mp4` / `.pdf` demo files are skipped by `.dockerignore`).
2. Render dashboard -> **New + -> Blueprint** -> select the repo. `render.yaml` creates the web service
   (Docker, with ffmpeg) **and** the PostgreSQL database `accident-db`, and links them through `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Fill in `SENDER_EMAIL`, `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, `RECEIVER_EMAIL`, `WEATHER_API_KEY` when Render asks.
4. Open `https://<your-service>.onrender.com`. Tables are created automatically on first start.

Stored in PostgreSQL: `incidents` (report JSON), `media` (evidence images + clip), `settings` (Settings page values).
Locally, without `DATABASE_URL`, everything still works from the `outputs/` folder.

Notes
* A Render server has **no webcam**. In the Live monitor use an `rtsp://` / `http://` camera or stream URL.
* Frames kept around an accident (approach -> overlap) = `EVENT_WINDOW_FRAMES = 200` in `live.py` (was 400).
* How long vehicles must overlap before an alert = `PROLONGED_COLLISION_FRAMES` in `pipeline.py` (currently 40).
